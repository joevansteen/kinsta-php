# EATSv5 - Hello World - PHP
A first case example of how to set up a PHP application for deployment on Kinsta App Hosting services

---
Kinsta has created a developer-centric cloud host / PaaS, a Platform as a Service. They are striving to make it easier for developers to build and implement web projects. The intention is for developers to be able to focus on coding and building the application functionality, and for Kinsta to take care of deployment and provide fast, scalable hosting. + 24/7 expert-only support.

This is a scheme which has been a long time coming. Previously the application developer, or an infrastructure support team, needed to be detail concerned about not only the application functionality, but also the infrastructure platform, and the interface of the application to the infrastructure platform, in a myriad of detail ways, before an application could be delivered and made available to users. PaaS represents a near full cycle return to the glass house environment of the 1970s with a clean separation of responsibility and concern over technology details between application development and the operational demands of system implementation on a specified hardware platform.

## Dependency Management
During the deployment process Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `composer.json` file.

## Web Server Setup
Kinsta will automatically configure an apache web server which will serve from the main directory of the project in the usual fashion; create an `index.php` file in your project folder as the entry-point.

## What is PHP
PHP is a popular server-side scripting language used primarily for web development. It enables developers to create dynamic web pages, interact with databases, and handle various web-related tasks efficiently. Learn more on [php.net](https://php.net).
